## the buildo project is specifically meant for serving a purpose similar to that of homeadvisor, angie, or any other. The point of this application is to bring clients and contractors or handy man workers together. In a world where good help can be hard to find Buildo aims to bridge that gap. A review system will allow clients or onlookers to see the top rated and must trustworthy workers, and an integrated friend and messaging system will aim to help bring a new aspect of communication never before seen in an app in this field.
